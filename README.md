SixenseJava
============

	A Java wrapper for the Sixense dynamic libraries.
    
    This wrapper has been tested and confirmed to work with the latest
    libraries as of 3/3/2014.
    
    Place dynamic libraries in the projact/program's root folder by default for
    SixenseJava to load the required libraries. An example for Windows:
    |-SixenseGame
      |-Game.jar
      |-SixenseJava.jar
      |-SixenseJava32.dll
      |-SixenseJava64.dll
      |-sixense.dll
      |-sixense_utils.dll
      |-sixense_x64.dll
      |-sixense_utils_x64.dll
    
    The libraries can also be placed in the Path if that works better or
    can be specify the java.library.path java system property by the
    -Djava.library.path= command line arguement or with
    System.setProperty(java.library.path) at runtime.
